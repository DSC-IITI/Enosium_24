                                For the first time ever, IIT Indore presents Énosium, a hackathon organized by the IIT
                                Indore chapter of the Google Developers Students Club and IIT Indore's premier AI/ML
                                body, the Cynaptics Club.
                                In today’s competitive world, ML is fast emerging as a very useful and in-demand skill.
                                Its applications are too many to count, and yet new ones are found every day. The smart
                                systems of the present and the future are based upon this powerful tool.
                                On the other hand, Web Development is a well-established skill that still holds immense
                                potential.

                                A website is usually the first thing that a user usually sees before using a digital
                                product. How well you can design your website plays a huge role on how successful your
                                product might be.
                                Keeping in mind the importance of both these domains, we decided to come up with a
                                platform for enthusiasts to learn and showcase their conjunction.
