                                Énosium, a hackathon organized by the Google Developers Students Club chapter and the Cynaptics Club at IIT Indore, converges the in-demand skill of Machine Learning (ML) with the well-established proficiency in Web Development. ML's pervasive applications and the foundational role of Web Development form the bedrock of contemporary smart systems. This event aims to explore the synergies between these two domains, recognizing their individual strengths and fostering collaboration to unlock new possibilities at the intersection of ML and Web Development.
